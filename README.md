Submission for Product Thinking Challenge for Meta Global Hackathon


Welcome to the Product Thinking challenge! This challenge is designed to challenge your creative skills and allow you to think outside the box. Work individually or in teams (more details below in the ‘ways of working’ section) to ideate solutions for real-life problems to share with the rest of the participants!

For this challenge you will have to choose one of the following scenarios depicting an existing large-scale problem and come up with a tech solution for it. Note that once you choose a scenario you can’t change your selection, so choose your path wisely!

The Scenarios:

You are tasked to create something …

    To help people preserve electricity
    To help people combat forest fires
    To make education more effective and accessible for rural communities
    To help humanity tackle another pandemic via distribution of medicine
    To allow people to travel more safely, either locally or internationally when alone

This challenge consists of two stages:

    Ideation (coming up with a creative solution and presenting for the other participants) - 15th September - 20th September
    Execution Planning (exploring the technical space and presenting a technical architecture to a panel of judges). 22nd September - 26th September

Let’s see more in detail what the two stages of this challenge are about.






Stage One: Ideation

Once you have selected which large-scale problem you will be solving, you’ll have until 20th September to come up with a creative tech solution for it. For this stage, you will have to build a small slide presentation (up to 2 slides - n.b. it must be a pdf file) in which you’ll be asked to specify:

    The problem you’re solving
    The high level idea for the solution
    How does it solve the problem at hand

For your presentation, we strongly recommend:

    Think big. Since you won’t be implementing this, feel free to explore ideas that are bigger than what your team could implement in the scope of this hack. You can assume a larger set of resources and development are available.
    … but still keep it realistic. We expect the ideas to be something possible to implement and reasonable given the size of the problem.
    … and clarify your assumptions! Assuming that you have certain resources or information available is ok, just make sure that you specify what your assumptions are.

Scoring:

Once everyone has submitted their initial ideas, voting will take place and every participant will have 10 votes to distribute among other entries in the competition. Voting will open on 20th September and close on 21st September.

The 20 to 24 most voted entries from the first stage will make it to the second stage.

Stage Two: Execution Planning

Now it’s time to get deep into the details of the solution! For this stage you will be required to provide a more detailed view of how your idea will be implemented in the form of a video presentation (up to 4 slides, 2 minutes).

This presentation should make it clear what the plan would look like to build your project and the feasibility of its implementation. If you’re working as a team you can choose to include everyone or nominate a presenter.

Judges award points to the 1st place (150), 2nd place (100) and 3rd place (50)
That’s it!

We hope you enjoy this challenge, and look forward to seeing which awesome ideas and implementation you can come up with. Good luck!
